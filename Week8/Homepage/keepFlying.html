          <h2>
            The video above is from a test flight performed in September 2022.
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Keep Flying team is, as explained briefly in the 'About Me'
            page, an AeroDesign team. We design, every year, a new cargo
            airplane capable of taking off weighing 20kg.
          </p>
          <p>
            It all starts with the conceptual design. In this phase, lots of
            different aircraft configurations (monoplane, biplane, flying wing)
            are compared briefly to give a sense of which configurations are the
            'most promising' given the rulebook's constraints.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following that the project enter in the Preliminary phase, where the
            team settles in one particular aircraft configuration and then
            procedes to perform an Multi Disciplinary Optimization (MDO), which
            is basically a genetic algorithm that will test lots and lots of
            variations of aircraft geometry and then, hopefully, arrive in an
            optimized geometry for the aircraft.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last phase is the Detailed phase, were the Project Spiral
            happens. Here, computational expensive methods, like CFD, are
            employed to refine our estimations of critical performance
            parameters of the aircraft. It's also in this phase that the 3D CAD
            model of the aircraft is finished and the manufacturing of the first
            prototype starts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, ideally, many test flights are completed to further develop
            our understanding of the aircraft and catch and fix any flaws in the
            design.
